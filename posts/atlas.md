Surprise! The Atlas will be getting it's own skin in Rumble. In order to recieve the skin, you have to witness the "Judgement" event on the Atlas game and get the badge from the event. Once you have recieved the badge you will be granted the "The Atlas" skin on Rumble. The skin is currently broken in lobby but it works perfectly fine in game!
